        <h2>WHY Yolanda?</h2>
        <h3>Why Yolanda is the best?</h3>
        <p>
          It's unusual for a cake artist to be so multi-talented. Yolanda is now
          a globally known famous, acclaimed cake designer while also being an
          incredible baker, business owner, book writter, and tv star.
        </p>
        <p>
          She is a famous baker and cake designer who runs the popular YouTube
          channel, ‘How to Cake it.’ She tasted online success just three months
          after her first post in February 2015, garnering as many as 14k
          subscribers and more than 230k views! As of June 2017, she had over
          3.1 million subscribers! She was already a TV star before she started
          her own YouTube channel. The reality show, ‘SugarStars,’ first
          premiered in the year 2012, covered her and her colleagues creating
          fancy cakes and sweet tables for parties. She also runs her own cake
          businesses in Toronto called, ‘Cakes by Yolanda’ and ‘Sweet Fix.’ Her
          passion for baking is hereditary as her father is also a baker by
          trade. She says that he is her inspiration and helped her learn
          everything about baking. Gampp is a complete package as she is a
          successful entrepreneur, cake decorator, YouTube sensation, TV star,
          and a fantastic mother as well! She has been baking almost all her
          life and doesn’t plan on stopping any time soon.
